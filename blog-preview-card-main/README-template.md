🎨 Blog Preview Card

This is my solution to the [Blog Preview Card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/blog-preview-card-solution-e3WfhbdXU0)

🚀. The goal was to build a responsive blog card that matches the Figma design, with a hover effect on the title. I worked on the desktop version first, then adapted it for mobile using media queries.
